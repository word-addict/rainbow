vintage-Tee 
brand new phone
high heels on
cobblestones
when we were young they assume you know nothing
cz i knew you stepping on the highline
once in twenty lifetimes

loving him was like driving a new masserati down the dead end street 

life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
more that you say, the less i know

august sipped away like a bottle of wine
cz he was never mine

salt air, and the rust on your door, I never needed anything more

in my defense i have none
My tears ricochet
